The images are in DICOM format and are categorized as CC (craniocaudal) and MLO (mediolateral oblique) types. Regarding the dataset, there is a folder named "DS1" on my desktop. Within this folder, there are subfolders corresponding to different BIRADS categories: "Kategori1" for BIRADS1 images, "Kategori2" for BIRADS2 images, "Kategori4" for BIRADS4 images, and "Kategori5" for BIRADS5 images. Each of these category folders contains subfolders named after patient IDs. For instance, if patient number 1006 belongs to Kategori1, one must first navigate to the Kategori1 folder, then to the 1006 folder to access the image files. The image files are named as follows: RMLO.dcm for right MLO, RCC.dcm for right CC, LMLO.dcm for left MLO, and LCC.dcm for left CC. This file structure applies to all DICOM files.

Additionally, there is an Excel file named "veribilgisi.xlsx" within the "DS1" folder. The first column of this file is labeled "Category" and contains the BIRADS categories (Kategori1, Kategori2, Kategori4, Kategori5). The second column, labeled "Patient_id," lists the patient IDs (e.g., 1006). The third column, "File_name," contains the corresponding file names (RCC.dcm, RMLO.dcm, LMLO.dcm, LCC.dcm). The fourth column, "Label_name," specifies whether the image contains Normal tissue, Mass, or Calcification. It should also be noted that the pixel dimensions of the images are not fixed and vary from image to image. The file path for the "DS1" folder is as follows: C:/Users/talha/Desktop/DS1.
