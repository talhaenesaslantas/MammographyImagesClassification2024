CONCLUSION

In this study, we developed a deep learning-based model for the classification of mammographic images into BI-RADS1, BI-RADS2, BI-RADS4, and BI-RADS5 categories. The dataset consisted of DICOM-format mammographic images categorized as CC and MLO types, with varying pixel dimensions across images. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, we sought to automate the classification of these images to assist in the diagnostic process for breast cancer screening and evaluation.

The confusion matrix generated from the model's predictions demonstrates promising performance across the majority of the BI-RADS categories. The model achieved high accuracy in classifying BI-RADS1 and BI-RADS5 categories, as reflected in the correct classification of 928 and 504 instances, respectively. This indicates that the model is particularly effective in identifying cases with clear benign (BI-RADS1) and highly suspicious (BI-RADS5) findings, which are crucial for reducing false negatives and improving diagnostic precision.

However, the classification results for BI-RADS2 and BI-RADS4 show some overlap, with the model misclassifying a notable number of BI-RADS2 images as BI-RADS4 and vice versa. Specifically, 21 BI-RADS2 images were classified as BI-RADS4, and 18 BI-RADS4 images were misclassified as BI-RADS2. These results suggest the need for further refinement of the model, particularly in distinguishing between these intermediate BI-RADS categories, where radiological features may be more subtle and challenging for automated systems to differentiate.

Overall, the model demonstrated a robust performance with a balanced accuracy across all categories, making it a valuable tool for assisting radiologists in the initial classification of mammographic images. Future work could focus on enhancing the model's sensitivity to nuanced radiological features that distinguish between closely related BI-RADS categories, such as BI-RADS2 and BI-RADS4. Additionally, integrating more advanced feature extraction techniques or incorporating clinical data could further improve the model's predictive accuracy and its practical applicability in clinical settings.

This work represents a significant step towards the development of AI-driven tools for breast cancer screening, with the potential to reduce diagnostic workloads and improve the consistency of BI-RADS classification.
